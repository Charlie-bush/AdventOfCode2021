# AdventOfCode2021
A Repository to keep track of my advent of code for 2021, depending on the challenge I may include both part 1 and part 2.

Often part 2 is enough of a variance from part one to warrant a separate class.

To use, change the class used in the runner to the corresponding day. Thought this would be the best method for code reusability.
